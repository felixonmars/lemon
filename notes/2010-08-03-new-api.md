# 2010-08-03 | A New API

Simplified API. There is one main method.

  unit_test SomeClass, :some_method, "description" do
    # test ...
  end

It will be a global method. The block notations would still work, but
they would simple become wrappers for the main method.

  testcase SomeClass do

    unit :some_method, "description" do

    end

  end

If I can make it backward compatible, I may also allow something like:

  testcase SomeClass do

    unit :some_method do

      concern "description" do

      end

    end

  end

By using this global method, I should be able to simplify the underlying
implementation a great deal, which has been major concern about Lemon
as of late.
