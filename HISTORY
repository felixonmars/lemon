= RELEASE HISTORY

== 0.7.0 / 2010-05-04

This release fixes issue with coverage reports. To do this
we have interoduced the +Covers+ method. This allows Lemon
to distingush between code that is inteded to be covered
by the tests and mere support code.

Keep in mind that there is no perfect way to handle coverage.
Even with the distiction the +Covers+ method provides, coverage
might not be reported exactly as desired. Other techinques can
be used to refine coverage however, such a preloading embedded
support libraries.

Changes:

* Add +Covers+ method to solidify coverage reporting.
* New Snapshot class improves encapsulation to coverage state.


== 0.6.0 / 2010-03-06

This release adds coverage reporting to testing and improves
the generator.

Changes:

* Runner can provide uncovered and undefined testunit list.
* Generator can exclude already covered testunits with -u option.
* Suite class has Coverage instance.


== 0.5.0 / 2009-12-31

This is the initial public release of Lemon. Lemon is
still under development and should be considered betaware,
but it's API is stable and the system usable enough to 
warrant a release.

Changes:

* Happy First Release Day!
