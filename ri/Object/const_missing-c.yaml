  body: "FIXME: This is a BIG FAT HACK! For the life of me I cannot find a way to resolve module constants included in the test cases. Becuase of closure, the constant lookup goes through here, and not the Case singleton class. So to work around we must note each test before it is run, and reroute the missing constants."

  body: This sucks and it is not thread safe. If anyone know how to fix, please let me know. See Unit#call for the other end of this hack.
